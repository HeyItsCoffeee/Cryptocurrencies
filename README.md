# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help a client, Accountability Accounting, prepare to enter the cryptocurrency market by creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment portfolio. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, unsupervised learning will be used to group the cryptocurrencies. The analysis will consist of four technical parts: preprocessing the data for PCA, reducing data dimensions using PCA, clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means, and visualizing the results. By the end of the analysis, the client will have a better understanding of the cryptocurrency market, and will be able to use the information to make informed decisions about their investment portfolio.
